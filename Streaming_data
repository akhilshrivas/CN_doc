Streaming data is data that is emitted at high volume in a continuous, incremental manner with the goal of low-latency processing. 
Organizations have thousands of data sources that typically simultaneously emit messages, records, or data ranging in size from a few bytes to several megabytes (MB). 
Streaming data includes location, event, and sensor data that companies use for real-time analytics and visibility into many aspects of their business. 
For example, companies can track changes in public sentiment on their brands and products by continuously analyzing clickstream and customer posts from social media streams then responding promptly as needed.
